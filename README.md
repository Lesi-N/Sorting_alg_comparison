# Sorting algorithms comparison
Homework project for testing effectiveness of merge, selection, insertion and shell sort

---

The project contains 7 modules:
- 4 for each of the sorting algorithms : `merge.py` , `insertion.py` , `seleciton.py` , `shell.py`
- a module for recording the execution time of each algorithm and the number of comparisons made: `timing.py`
- a module for generating different types of lists to test the algorithms on: `generate_lists.py`
- `main.py` , which imports all above modules and conducts the experiments, printing the results in the process
